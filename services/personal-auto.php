A personal auto insurance policy covers all things that are considered “personal” in nature. These include your drives back and forth to your office for work, trips to the grocery store, and leisure activities. Your auto policy covers the vehicles and household drivers you specifically list on the policy and is geared towards protecting individuals that use their car for regular personal purposes.<br><br>
Personal auto policies only cover specific types of vehicle use, registered in an individual’s name. You’ll need commercial coverage if you buy a car in your company name or own a truck, bus, or vehicle that is considered a commercial use and gross vehicle weight. There is often a bit of grey area and confusion regarding the use of a personal auto for jobs like newspaper delivery or pizza delivery. You’ll want to check with your insurance professional to determine whether or not your insurance company considers that type of work an acceptable risk.

      <section>
        <h4><span class="question">Can auto insurance cover vandalism?</span> </h4>
        <p>If your car is vandalized, any necessary repairs would be covered so long as you have comprehensive insurance. Comprehensive insurance covers all costs associated with vandalism, though you usually have to pay a deductible. In this article we go more in-depth into cases involving vandalism and auto insurance.

        <h4><span class="question">What auto insurance coverage is required on all cars?</span> </h4>
        <p>Liability Insurance
Liability insurance covers you in the event you are in a covered car accident and it is determined the accident is a result of your actions. Liability insurance will cover the cost of repairing any property damaged by an accident as well as the medical bills from resulting injuries. Most states have a minimum requirement for the amount of liability insurance coverage that drivers must have. If you can afford it, however, it is usually a good idea to have liability insurance that is above your state's minimum liability coverage requirement, as it will provide extra protection in the event you are found at fault for an accident, as you are responsible for any claims that exceed your coverage's upper limit. You wouldn't want to run the risk of having to pay a large amount of money because your policy limit has been exceeded.

        <h4><span class="question">What insurance group is my car?</span> </h4>
        <p>Each car is placed into one of 50 groups by the Group Rating Panel; the higher the group, the more expensive the vehicle is to insure. They decide on which vehicle should go into which group based on the following criteria:
• Cost of Repair – this takes into account the cost of both parts and labour
• Level of security
• The price of the car when it first enters the market
• It’s performance – this is where acceleration and top speed are accounted for

This is especially true for those companies that utilize trucks, vans and cars as the main source of income for their business. With the vehicles always on the road, there may be instances where drivers can get into accidents with other vehicles or in other occasions, the vehicle may be damaged due to extreme weather conditions. With the right commercial insurance, you are sure to be protected from these unforeseen circumstances.
