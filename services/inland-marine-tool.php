    Tools and equipment coverage, <strong class="bold">also known as inland marine insurance</strong>, protects your hard working assets from all-too-common risks, like theft and damage, as you transport them to and from your worksite.</p>
        <?php include('../quote-general.php');?>
        <p>
As a contractor or construction professional, you regularly transport the tools, equipment, and supplies you need to get the job done. While your valuable business assets are in motion, tools and equipment insurance ensures their replacement should an accident, theft, or loss happen along the way. It can also cover tools that your construction or contracting crew takes with them when they perform a job.<br><br>
        </p>
<h2 class="sub">Tools and equipment insurance commonly includes coverage for the following types of property:</h2><br>
        <div class="dot">Property in transit, such as contractor's tools and supplies.</div>
        <div class="dot">Mobile equipment, such as forklifts, dozers, track hoes, maintainers, loaders.</div>
      <div class="dot">Computer equipment and data, such as accounting software, lead-tracking data, policies, procedures, and other electronic assets.</div>  
      <div class="dot">Damage, loss, destruction, theft.</div><br><br>
<p>
From the smallest hand tools to larger equipment such as welders, nail guns, generators and other high-value items, replacement costs can add up fast if your tools are stolen or damaged.

        <h4><span class="question">4. When would I use my contractors tool insurance?</span> </h4>
        <p>Contractorâ€™s tool/equipment insurance is used mainly when your loss or a claim exceeds your deductible. A deductible is the normally $500.00 per claim. So, for instance, you are on the job site and someone takes your entire tool box out of the back-end of your truck. More than likely you could have thousands of dollars of tools in that box. In this case, you would pay the first $500.00 to cover your loss and the insurance company would pay the balance.
