Depending on state laws and contract requirements, you may need this policy to cover employees, contractors, freelancers, or even yourself.<br><br>Most states require employers to buy Workers' Compensation Insurance as soon as they hire their first employee. Even when that's not the case, it's smart to have this policy, because the cost of workplace injuries is substantial:<br><br><u>As Workers Compensations rates continue to rise, so do operating costs which diminish your ability to thrive.</u> The most important factors to consider in placing any business with an insurance company is strength, claims handling, service and price of the policy. By placing your business with a secure and competitively-priced company, you minimize the possibility of staff reductions and maximize your growth potential.</p>
