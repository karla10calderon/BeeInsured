              <h4><span class="question">How do auto insurance companies manage risk?</span></h4>

              <h4><span class="question">Why commercial auto insurance?</span></h4>
            <p>It is very important for businesses to have commercial auto insurance. This is especially true for those companies that utilize trucks, vans and cars as the main source of income for their business. With the vehicles always on the road, there may be instances where drivers can get into accidents with other vehicles or in other occasions, the vehicle may be damaged due to extreme weather conditions. With the right commercial insurance, you are sure to be protected from these unforeseen circumstances.</p>

              <h4><span class="question">Why full coverage commercial auto insurance?</span></h4>
            <p>Many think they carry “full coverage" on their car insurance policy; however, in reality there is no such thing as full coverage auto insurance. A full coverage policy is typically one that includes several types of car insurance coverage that, as a whole, provide a solid level of protection in case of an accident.</p>

           <section>
              <h4><span class="question">Will auto insurance cover mechanical repairs?</span></h4>
            <p>Generally, your policy won't cover the failure of your ride's engine or other mechanical parts if the damage is due to wear and tear or general mechanical failure.
So, for example, if your engine suffers damage as part of a manufacturer's recall, or a brittle belt breaks and damages mechanical components in your car, or you accidentally destroy your engine by driving with low oil for an extended period — these are all instances in which you'd usually be financially responsible for repairing your ride. And it's always a good idea to check if your car's still under warranty — you could save major cash if damaged parts are still covered by the manufacturer.
</p></section><section>
              <h4><span class="question">Will auto insurance cover medical expenses?</span></h4>
            <p>Liability coverage will cover damage to the other party if you are involved in an accident. If you are injured in an accident and are not at fault, chances are that the other party’s liability insurance will pay for your medical bills. The part of liability insurance that will cover your medical expenses is known at bodily injury liability coverage.</p>

        <p>Contractor’s tool/equipment insurance is used mainly when your loss or a claim exceeds your deductible. A deductible is the normally $500.00 per claim. So, for instance, you are on the job site and someone takes your entire tool box out of the back-end of your truck. More than likely you could have thousands of dollars of tools in that box. In this case, you would pay the first $500.00 to cover your loss and the insurance company would pay the balance.

        <h4><span class="question">What auto insurance coverage is required on all cars?</span> </h4>
        <p>Liability Insurance
Liability insurance covers you in the event you are in a covered car accident and it is determined the accident is a result of your actions. Liability insurance will cover the cost of repairing any property damaged by an accident as well as the medical bills from resulting injuries. Most states have a minimum requirement for the amount of liability insurance coverage that drivers must have. If you can afford it, however, it is usually a good idea to have liability insurance that is above your state's minimum liability coverage requirement, as it will provide extra protection in the event you are found at fault for an accident, as you are responsible for any claims that exceed your coverage's upper limit. You wouldn't want to run the risk of having to pay a large amount of money because your policy limit has been exceeded.

        <h4><span class="question">Why is homeowner insurance Important?</span> </h4>
        <p> Your home is your castle. It’s a safe and secure place where you can relax and make memories with friends and family. It’s also one of your biggest investments. That’s why it’s important to protect your property with homeowners insurance.More than 90 percent of all property owners have safeguarded their homes with at least some insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute. That still leaves millions of homes uninsured, and at risk of major financial losses in the event of natural disaster or other tragic events. </p>

        <h4><span class="question">How does home insurance work?</span> </h4>
        <p>Insurance is something most people don't even want to think about until they need it the most. But, understanding what is and isn't covered in your homeowners insurance policy can mean the difference of being able to rebuild your home and replace your personal belongings. Homeowners need to do annual insurance policy "check ups" to make sure they keep up with local building costs, home remodeling and inventories of their personal belongings. The typical homeowners insurance policy covers damage resulting from fire, windstorm, hail, water damage (excluding flooding), riots and explosion as well as other causes of loss, such as theft and the extra cost of living elsewhere which the structure is being repaired or rebuilt. Your policy also covers your legal liability (up to policy limits) if you, members of your family or even your pets hurt other people or their property, not just in your house.</p>

        <h4><span class="question">When to buy home insurance?</span> </h4>
        <p>Making the decision to buy a first home is really exciting; often these decisions come connected to other major life decisions like getting married or having children, but more and more, people are realizing that investing money into your own property, instead of spending it on rent just makes sense long term.

Whether you are buying a condo, a mobile home, or a house, you will want to find insurance that will adequately protect your investment as well as your personal belongings while saving money.

        <h4><span class="question">Can you deduct homeowners insurance?</span> </h4>
        <p>There are two instances in which you can deduct insurance payments from your home. If you use your home or part of it for business, you may be able to use the square footage of your home space used for business as a percentage of the total home square footage to allocate to your homeowners' insurance expense. If you're a landlord and claim rental income on your home, your homeowners' insurance on the portion of the property used for rental becomes tax-deductible. When you own several properties and those properties are used only for rental income, then all of the homeowners' insurance is tax-deductible. </p>
