        General liability insurance protects you and your organization from claims involving bodily injuries and property damage. Every business, no matter how small a need for general liability insurance has because it protects your business against property damage, advertising injury claims, personal injury claims, and bodily injury claims. The type of your <strong class="bold">general liability insurance is determined by various factors </strong>which include the business type, location of your business, the total number of employees in your business, as well as the risk level your business is exposed to. For example, a roofer working on a roof faces much higher risks than an accountant sitting in an office behind a desk.
        
        <br><br>
        It's easy to get <strong class="bold">general liability coverage for your business</strong> by providing a few simple details about your business, such as location, nature of business and contact details. You can go visit an insurance company or directly get a quote within minutes with a few clicks of a mouse on his computer. A consultant will normally then get in touch with you to discuss the details of your quote. For example, your business owns a single truck or 100 trucks you need commercial truck insurance that matches your particular risks and the perils your drivers face on the roadway is important to the success of your business even if you have just one commercial truck that is used for deliveries, or perhaps you have an entire fleet of trucks that deliver freight throughout the country.

        As a small business you need to get <strong class="bold">General Liability Insurance coverage </strong>shortly after founding your business because you could need it in a variety of situations like; applying for a professional license (e.g., a plumber's license), signing contracts with larger companies or signing an office lease. The limit of general liability is that most the insurer will pay for all sums as damages because of bodily injury, property damage, personal and advertising injury apart for those sums paid as damages because of bodily injury or property damage included within the products-completed operations hazard. The products-completed operations hazard is defined in the policy and a separate aggregate limit applies to such claims or suits.
