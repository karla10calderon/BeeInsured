    <h2 class="sub">Umbrella Insurance is extra liability Insurance.</h2><br>
        This type of insurance policy is designed to help protect you from major claims and lawsuits and consequently, it helps protect your assets and your future. It does this by providing additional <strong class="bold">liability coverage above the limits of your homeowners and autopolicies. </strong>This protection is designed to kick in when the liability on these other policies has been exhausted. It also provides coverage for claims that may be excluded by other liability policies including false arrest, libel, slander, and liability coverage on rental units you own. Specifically, umbrella insurance provides coverage for, injuries, damage to property certain lawsuits like; slander, libel, false arrest, detention, or imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and the likes.<br><br>
        Umbrella insurance is important because if you are sued for a lot of money and do not have enough liability insurance, an umbrella policy will cover those costs, or all of your assets are exposed. People typically choose to <strong class="bold">buy an umbrella policy</strong> because they want to prevent the possibility of financial ruin due to one misstep or unforeseen accident.
<div class="boxheader">This protection is designed to kick in when the liability on these other policies has been exhausted.</div>
        The cost of an umbrella liability policy depends on how much coverage you purchase, the state where you live (insurance rates vary by state) and the risk that insuring you presents to the insurance company. The more homes or cars you own, and the more family members your policy will cover, the more it will cost. <strong class="bold">Coverage for an umbrella policy</strong> typically starts in the rage of $150-$200 for a $1 million policy.<br><br>
        A <strong class="bold">personal umbrella policy</strong>, your premiums are not typically tax deductible but if you own a business and have an umbrella policy that supplements your other business liability policies, your premiums may be tax deductible.<br><br> When choosing your coverage limits, consider three things: the risks you may face, the value of your assets and the potential loss of future income. You can buy an umbrella insurance policy through many different insurance companies and agents, but one of the <strong class="bold">best ways to get umbrella insurance</strong> is through Beeinsured Insurance.
