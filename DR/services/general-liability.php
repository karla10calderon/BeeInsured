    <p>Every business needs to <strong>protect themselves from accidents or injuries</strong> that may occur on their business grounds.<br><br>
        <strong>General Liability insurance coverage</strong> can protect your business from these unexpected expenses, so it is essential that you understand what it does and doesn't cover.<br><br>
        
    General liability covers business related incidents that result in bodily injury to a third-party. This can include a customer slipping and falling on your premises, or an employee accidentally dropping a toolbox on someone‚Äôs foot. Of course, this coverage only applies to non-employee injuries.<br><br>
        
    Additionally, general liability protects any third-party property damage resulting from your business operations. For example, a landscaper‚Äôs policy may cover a stone that kicks up from their lawn mower and breaks a client‚Äôs window.<br><br>
<b>General liability insurance can cover</b> <br><br>

    -Expenses to repair at a business. <br>
-Expenses to replace customer property that is damaged at a business. <br>
-Professional mistakes. <br>
-Intentional damage. <br>
-Bodily injury and property damage liability<br>
-Personal and advertising injury<br>
-Legal Fees<br>
-Medical payments<br>
-Products completed operations<br>
-Damage to premises rented to you<br>

     <h3 class="faqsection">Common questions about General Liability Insurance</h3>
      <amp-accordion>
      <section>
        <h4><span class="question">Why general liability insurance?</span> </h4>
        <p> Commercial General Liability Insurance is one of the most important coverages you can buy for your business. It can help cover the costs of bodily injury, property and advertising damage claims made against your business. Without this coverage, you may have to pay the cost of these claims with your own business and personal assets. In today‚Äôs world of ever-increasing business lawsuits, don‚Äôt leave your business vulnerable to the potentially devastating costs of a liability claim.</p>
      </section>

         
        <section>
        <h4><span class="question">What does general liability insurance covers?</span> </h4>
        <p>General Liability Insurance doesn't cover every lawsuit, but it covers many of the most common and expensive. GL Insurance includes coverage for third-party lawsuits over‚Ä¶
Property damage.
Client and third-party injuries (e.g., a customer trips over a power cord or slips on a wet floor).
Reputational injuries (e.g., a competitor claims you damaged its reputation in an ad).
Problems with your construction / installation (aka Completed Products coverage).

        <h4><span class="question">Is general liability insurance required by law?</span> </h4>
        <p>Most types of business insurance are optional and some are only recommended for certain types of businesses. However, while not required by law, a property and casualty insurance policy is highly recommended for all business owners.

              <section>
        <h4><span class="question">How does general liability insurance work?</span> </h4>
        <p>Business is inherently risky, but business liability coverage safeguards against many known and unknown risks. Commercial general liability insurance coverage protects you, your business and your employees from claims involving bodily injury or property damage, up to the limits of your policy. Policies shield you from the expense of out-of-court settlements, litigation and judgments awarded by courts.

              <section>
        <h4><span class="question">How much is general liability insurance for contractors?</span> </h4>
        <p>Here's how it works: if a GL lawsuit costs $1.5 million, but your policy only covers $1 million, Umbrella Insurance can cover the $500,000 remainder. Umbrella Insurance typically costs general contractors $1,010 to $2,020 in annual premiums.</p>

      </section>
          
             <section>
        <h4><span class="question">What are general liability limits?</span> </h4>
        <p>All insurance professionals need to understand how the limits of liability apply in the commercial general liability policy. Whether providing advice to a policyholder regarding the purchase of limits or in complying with the underlying requirements of an umbrella or excess liability policy, a working knowledge of how much will be paid is crucial.
