    General liability covers business related incidents that result in bodily injury to a third-party. This can include a customer slipping and falling on your premises, or an employee accidentally dropping a toolbox on someone’s foot. Of course, this coverage only applies to non-employee injuries.<br><br>
        
    Additionally, general liability protects any third-party property damage resulting from your business operations. For example, a landscaper’s policy may cover a stone that kicks up from their lawn mower and breaks a client’s window.<br><br>

     <h3 class="faqsection">Common questions about General Liability Insurance</h3>
      <amp-accordion>
      <section>
        <h4><span class="question">1. Why general liability insurance?</span> </h4>
        <p> Commercial General Liability Insurance is one of the most important coverages you can buy for your business. It can help cover the costs of bodily injury, property and advertising damage claims made against your business. Without this coverage, you may have to pay the cost of these claims with your own business and personal assets. In today’s world of ever-increasing business lawsuits, don’t leave your business vulnerable to the potentially devastating costs of a liability claim.</p>

        <h4><span class="question">2. What does general liability insurance covers?</span> </h4>
        <p>General Liability Insurance doesn't cover every lawsuit, but it covers many of the most common and expensive. GL Insurance includes coverage for third-party lawsuits over…
Property damage.
Client and third-party injuries (e.g., a customer trips over a power cord or slips on a wet floor).
Reputational injuries (e.g., a competitor claims you damaged its reputation in an ad).
Problems with your construction / installation (aka Completed Products coverage).

        <h4><span class="question">3. Is general liability insurance required by law?</span> </h4>
        <p>Most types of business insurance are optional and some are only recommended for certain types of businesses. However, while not required by law, a property and casualty insurance policy is highly recommended for all business owners.

        <h4><span class="question">4. How does general liability insurance work?</span> </h4>
        <p>Business is inherently risky, but business liability coverage safeguards against many known and unknown risks. Commercial general liability insurance coverage protects you, your business and your employees from claims involving bodily injury or property damage, up to the limits of your policy. Policies shield you from the expense of out-of-court settlements, litigation and judgments awarded by courts.

        <h4><span class="question">5. How much is general liability insurance for contractors?</span> </h4>
