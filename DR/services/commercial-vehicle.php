        <section>
        <h4><span class="question">1. How does commercial auto Insurance Works? </span> </h4>
        <p>Car insurance is designed to protect drivers and their passengers from financial hardship after an accident or other vehicle-related incident. Auto insurance, or other proof of financial responsibility, is mandated in every state.

</p>
      </section>
          
              <section>
        <h4><span class="question">2. How do auto insurance companies manage risk? </span> </h4>
        <p>The insurance industry is a world of calculated risk. Car insurance companies base their rates on how likely you are to file a claim in the future, and they use a number of varying factors to determine that risk. While it is impossible to know the exact formula any auto insurance carrier uses to calculate risk and determine premium rates, knowing common rating factors can help you shop smarter for your car insurance. It can also help you understand how changes in your life may affect your current policy's premiums.

           <section>
        <h4><span class="question">3. How much  does auto insurance cost?</span> </h4>
        <p>How much is car insurance going to cost you? It’s not an easy question to answer. The quote you receive could be painfully high or comfortably low based on a number of different factors. But for what it’s worth, the average amount spent to insure a car in the U.S. was $815 a year, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.</p>
      </section>   
       
           <section>
        <h4><span class="question">4. When to get auto insurance?</span> </h4>
        <p>Make sure to call your car insurance agent before you head to the dealership, so you have all the information you need before you buy a vehicle. You won't be able to drive that new car off the dealer's lot until you can prove it's covered by your insurance.</p>

             <section>
        <h4><span class="question">5. Why commercial auto insurance?</span> </h4>
        <p>It is very important for businesses to have commercial auto insurance. This is especially true for those companies that utilize trucks, vans and cars as the main source of income for their business. With the vehicles always on the road, there may be instances where drivers can get into accidents with other vehicles or in other occasions, the vehicle may be damaged due to extreme weather conditions. With the right commercial insurance, you are sure to be protected from these unforeseen circumstances.

            <section>
        <h4><span class="question">6. Why full coverage commercial auto insurance?</span> </h4>
        <p> Many think they carry “full coverage" on their car insurance policy; however, in reality there is no such thing as full coverage auto insurance. A full coverage policy is typically one that includes several types of car insurance coverage that, as a whole, provide a solid level of protection in case of an accident.

      </section>
       
             <section>
        <h4><span class="question">7. Will auto insurance cover mechanical repairs?</span> </h4>
        <p> Generally, your policy won't cover the failure of your ride's engine or other mechanical parts if the damage is due to wear and tear or general mechanical failure.
So, for example, if your engine suffers damage as part of a manufacturer's recall, or a brittle belt breaks and damages mechanical components in your car, or you accidentally destroy your engine by driving with low oil for an extended period — these are all instances in which you'd usually be financially responsible for repairing your ride. And it's always a good idea to check if your car's still under warranty — you could save major cash if damaged parts are still covered by the manufacturer.
</p>
      </section>
       
             <section>
        <h4><span class="question">8. Will auto insurance cover medical expenses?</span> </h4>
        <p>Liability coverage will cover damage to the other party if you are involved in an accident. If you are injured in an accident and are not at fault, chances are that the other party’s liability insurance will pay for your medical bills. The part of liability insurance that will cover your medical expenses is known at bodily injury liability coverage
