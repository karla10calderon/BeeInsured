        Auto insurance is a contract between you and the insurance company that <strong class="bold">protects you against financial loss in the event of an accident or theft.</strong> In exchange for your paying a premium, the insurance company agrees to pay your losses as outlined in your policy. Even though you already have auto insurance, it may not cover vandalism.  This is because there are many types of auto insurance, the one that you have will determine the benefits that will be accrued to you.  However, when it comes to <strong class="bold">protecting your vehicle from vandalism and other non-collision events,</strong> comprehensive insurance provides you with full coverage as well as peace of mind. When you purchase auto insurance, you’re actually purchasing several different types of insurance that protect against various things.
        <div class="boxheader">When you purchase auto insurance, you’re actually purchasing several different types of insurance that protect against various things.</div>
        <h2 class="sub">Auto insurance rates are determined by some factors which include:</h2> Your past driving record, gaps in insurance coverage, the vehicle you drive, where you live and your annual mileage. The cost of auto insurance is also dependent on some factors like where you live and what kind of car you drive, your driving habits and the level of coverage you choose.<br><br>
        Averagely, the cost should be around $815 a year. Some of these coverages are optional while some are required by law. Liability auto insurance covers the medical expenses and property damage that result from an accident you caused, up to the limits of your policy and it is required by all states apart from New Hampshire. Also, <strong class="bold">personal injury protection is only required in no-fault states</strong> or states that have laws in place limiting car accident lawsuits.
