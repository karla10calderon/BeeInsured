        <strong class="bold">Motorcycle insurance covers repairs or replacement if your bike is damaged or stolen</strong>, as well as damages you or another rider who is covered by your may cause in an accident. Standard motorcycle insurance policies include; bodily injury and property damage liability insurance, which riders are required to have in most states. Which motorcycle insurance coverages and the cost of it depend on your bike and its value, whether you want coverage for your own injuries if involved in an accident and how much protection you want for your belongings.<br><br>
        <h2 class="sub">Motorcycle insurance is similar to car insurance in that the policy offers you financial protection for injuries or damages incurred while driving your vehicle.</h2> <br><strong class="bold">A typical motorcycle insurance policy includes liability insurance,</strong> which pays for any damages you cause to others, but it can also include coverage for your own bike and injuries. If you have more than one motorcycle, you can purchase a multi-bike policy and often receive a discount from your insurer.<br><br>
Comprehensive motorcycle insurance covers the cost to repair or replace your motorcycle in the event nearly anything other than a collision occurs. For example, if your bike was damaged in a fire or storm, vandalized, or stolen, those things would fall under comprehensive coverage. This coverage is valuable even when you’re not riding the bike.
        <div class="boxheader">If you have more than one motorcycle, you can purchase a multi-bike policy and often receive a discount from your insurer.</div><br>
        Motorcycle insurance is required in all states. Here are some coverages you can apply for.<strong class="bold"> Property damage liability insurance cover damages that you may cause to other motorists</strong> and their property in the event of an accident. Contents and personal belongings coverage apply to any of the possessions that you carry with you while riding your bike. <br><br>
Some motorcycle insurance policies cover track days, but this isn’t always the case. If you intend to ride your motorcycle on the track, you should ask if you are covered. 
        Bike insurance is typically about 30% less than auto insurance when you just comparing the hardware. However, the risk of injury while driving a motorcycle is higher than when driving a car, so many states require a higher amount of liability and hospitalization coverage, this makes it be more expensive. To <strong class="bold">save money on bike insurance</strong> you should; choose a smaller, older or less expensive bike, avoid modified and unusual motorbikes, limit your mileage, pay annually and improve your motorbike's security.
