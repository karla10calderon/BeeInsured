        The medium-term loan is the type of loan that is required for investment and for replacement of some fixed assets. It is raised for a period of ranging from one year to five to ten years Objective of a medium-term loan is identical to that ofrollover credit or operating and capital leasing, i.e. using a <strong class="bold">bank loan to finance investments in standard tangible and intangible assets,</strong> and thereby allowing for the creation, improvement or development of a business activity. Specifically, it can be used to finance the fitting out of offices or showrooms or production areas or storage buildings, production tools, machinery, vehicles, intangible assets (business assets, patents, licenses) and sometimes the late payment of fiscal payables (taxes, social security contributions). 
        <div class="boxheader"> Your business and the financial need will help to determine the type of financial assistance that you need.</div>
        
        Loans that are specifically designed for <strong class="bold">small businesses and can be used for nearly anything your business requires.</strong> A long-term loan is a loan that is required for investment in assets like land, building, plant, house, and machinery, fixtures and fittings, patent rights and other fixed assets, and also for financing extension or expansion of the business. A long-term loan is raised for a period of more than 10 years. Your business and the financial need will help to determine the type of financial assistance that you need.<br><br>
        For every individual who <strong class="bold">requires a loan to finance his business,</strong> there always a special package designed to suit the needs of everyone. For example, there is a veteran business loan. A veteran business loan is available through multiple sources and can be any type of financing that veteran entrepreneurs receive, which are usually accompanied by business development tools. This debt financing can be used to gear veteran entrepreneurs in helping them grow their businesses.<br><br> However,<strong class="bold"> having a poor credit history</strong> can often hinder business finance applications, especially through the more traditional routes. To get a loan, detailedreport (based on a potential borrower's loan application and creditworthiness), presented usually by a bank's officer. A business loan proposal should be written, and this proposal should tell the lender the purpose of the needed financing, the justification for the funds, and the structure of the proposed loan.
